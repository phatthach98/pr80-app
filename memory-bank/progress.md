# Project Progress

## What Works
- Clean architecture structure is established for both backend and frontend
- User authentication (login functionality)
- User management APIs (CRUD operations)
- Role management APIs
- Permission management system
- Settings management APIs and selection options
- API error handling framework
- Project build and development environment with Docker
- Basic dish option entity structure

## What's Left to Build

### Order Flow Entities and APIs
- Complete dish option and selection option management functionality
  - DishOption as customization categories
  - SelectOption as specific choices within each DishOption
  - Additional pricing rules for selection options
- Implement Dish entity with detailed features
  - Name, description and base price
  - Category management
  - Availability status
  - Image management
  - Association with multiple dish options
- Create OrderItem entity with comprehensive functionality
  - Quantity and price calculations
  - Reference to a Dish
  - Selected Dish Options tracking
  - Special instructions support
- Develop Order entity with complete workflow
  - Status progression (new → in-preparation → ready → delivered → completed)
  - Table assignment
  - Timestamps for status changes
  - Order history and tracking
- Order management system implementation
  - Filtering and search capabilities
  - Reporting and analytics

### Additional Backend Features
- Role and permission-based authorization for API endpoints
- WebSocket/Socket.io server for real-time order updates
- Comprehensive testing for all entities and use cases
- API documentation and usage examples
- Deployment pipeline setup
- Performance optimization for high-volume operations

### Frontend Development
- Role-specific views (chef, waiter, manager)
- Order workflow and status management UI
- Frontend components for dishes, dish options, and orders
- Real-time order updates in user interfaces
- Mobile responsiveness
- Accessibility compliance

## Current Status
The project is in active development with an initial focus on backend API development and socket server implementation. Frontend development will follow after core backend functionality is complete.

### Backend Status
- Core architecture is implemented and working well
- Authentication is functional but lacks role-based authorization
- User, role, and permission management APIs are complete
- Settings management is functional
- Dish option feature is being implemented
- Order management system is planned but not yet implemented
- WebSocket server for real-time updates is planned but not yet implemented
- Error handling framework is in place but needs refinement

### Frontend Status
- Clean architecture structure is defined
- Basic components are available
- Theme system is in place
- Development is paused until backend APIs are more complete
- Role-specific views will be implemented after backend authorization

## Known Issues
- API endpoints lack proper role and permission-based authorization
- Error handling middleware needs refinements for consistent error responses
- Dish option repository implementation is incomplete
- No WebSocket/Socket.io configuration for real-time updates
- Lack of comprehensive test coverage for existing functionality
- Missing transaction support for operations that affect multiple entities
- Some API endpoints may not follow REST principles consistently
- Documentation is incomplete for newer features
- No integration tests for API endpoints
